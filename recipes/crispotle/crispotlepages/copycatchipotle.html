    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
       <li>1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper</li>
       <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
       <li>½ cup water</li>
       <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
       <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
       <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
   

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. 
            Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.</li>
        <li>Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.</li>
        <li>Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. 
            Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. 
            Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
